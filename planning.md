no planning yet, 

i have to check which tools i wanne use for this.

i want to use the following features and ideas: 
- The project is an App that will be downloadable
- The app needs to use the current locations of the phone.
- The app tracks live data when the public transport will arrive.

The idea is to have like on the stations is to see when the buss will arrive and show that time to you, no planning, no route planner, just to see when the bus will come inclusief the delays it got.
